  <!--I want this page to look like a coffee table that showcases each category as a book,magazine or flyer. The cover letter is a flyer, goals will be a small magazine detailing my goals,values, and beliefs. Education and previous works will be their own books, each project being its own book, and contact me will  be a post it note.-->
  <p class="biography">I am a junior Full Stack Web Developer with a majority of my experience coming from freelance work but I am excited and eager to start working with a team on bigger projects.
      I like to think of myself as a hard working individual who is passionate about his work. I strive to out do myself each and every time I begin working
      on any new projects. Although my coding skills are at an intermediate level, my work ethic and my eagerness to learn are always at their highest levels.</p>
