This is a personal website that I will be using to demo my skills as a full stack web developer.
The website will go through many stages:
 - A mostly HTML base site
 - CSS will be added to add some additional styling
 - a complete draft using only HTML and CSS
 - Java will be implemented in order to add even more styling, functionality, and *seasoning*
